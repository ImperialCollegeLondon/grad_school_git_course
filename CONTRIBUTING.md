# Contributing

We are very interested in receiving feedback on these materials, particularly
from anybody who has attended the course.

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling
mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error.

1.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create
    one][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems
    or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues].  This allows us to
    assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

2.  If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,
    you can submit a pull request (PR).  Instructions for doing this are
    [included below](#using-github).

## Where to Contribute

1.  If you wish to change this lesson,
    please work in <https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/grad_school_git_course>,
    which can be viewed at <https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/grad_school_git_course>.

## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and improving
existing ones to updating or filling in the documentation and submitting [bug
reports][issues] about things that don't work, aren't clear, or are missing. If
you are looking for ideas, please see the 'Issues' tab for a list of issues
associated with this repository.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are
smarter together than we are on our own.  Reviews from novices and newcomers are
particularly valuable: it's easy for people who have been using these lessons
for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so fresh
eyes are always welcome.

If you would like to propose new content or exercises please make sure to create
an issue and get the thoughts of the maintainers. Please try to bear in mind
that any new material must be compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].  To manage
changes, we follow [GitHub flow][github-flow].  This lesson is maintained by the
Research Software Engineering team at Imperial College, who will review and
approve any contributions.  To use the web interface for contributing to a
lesson:

1.  Fork the originating repository to your GitHub profile.
2.  Within your version of the forked repository, move to the `gh-pages` branch
    and create a new branch for each significant change being made.
3.  Navigate to the file(s) you wish to change within the new branches and make
    revisions as required.
4.  Commit all changed files within the appropriate branches.
5.  Create individual pull requests from each of your changed branches
    to the `gh-pages` branch within the originating repository.
6.  If you receive feedback, make changes using your issue-specific branches of
    the forked repository and the pull requests will update automatically.
7.  Repeat as needed until all feedback has been addressed.

When starting work, please make sure your clone of the originating `gh-pages`
branch is up-to-date before creating your own revision-specific branch(es) from
there.  Additionally, please only work from your newly-created branch(es) and
*not* your clone of the originating `gh-pages` branch.  Lastly, published copies
of all the lessons are available in the `gh-pages` branch of the originating
repository for reference while revising.
