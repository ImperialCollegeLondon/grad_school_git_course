This course introduces the version control system Git, an essential tool for tracking and managing software development. Working with Git provides the flexibility to freely make changes to your code and the security to know you can always get back to a working state. You will learn to track the changes you made to your code and when you made them. 

Beyond working on your own code, understanding Git allows usage of online code repositories such as GitHub. Using an online repository to publish your code is a great way to disseminate your research and a necessary step to collaborate with others. This course will demonstrate how to publish code to Github and introduce the features that make it a productive collaborative environment. 

This course will cover: 
* An introduction to Git concepts and terminology 
* Using Git to track changes in your code 
* How to prepare your code for publication 
* Publishing your code using Github 
* Using Git and Github to collaborate as part of a team 

This course (particularly the first half) is closely based on this [Code
Refinery lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).
