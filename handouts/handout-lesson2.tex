\begin{navybox}[title=Things to think when publishing code]
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep\itempad
  \item \textbf{Public or Private?} - What level of visibility should your
    project to have? Open code promotes reproducibility and impact but be sure
    to consider and consult any other contributors
  \item \textbf{README.md} - The `front page' of a repository. GitHub will
    automatically render the markdown in this file nicely
  \item \textbf{Licence} - Tell other people what they can and cannot do with
    your code. The College recommended licence is BSD 2- or 3-clause
  \item \textbf{INSTALL.md} - If your project is complex to setup and install be
    sure to include detailed instructions
  \item \textbf{CITATION.txt} - Show how your project should be cited by others
  \item \textbf{CONTRIBUTING.md} - Tell potential contributors the kind of work
    you're interested in and the process they should follow
  \end{itemize}
