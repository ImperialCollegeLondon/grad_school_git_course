\subsection*{Further Help}
This course was developed by the Research Computing Service (RCS) of Imperial
College, in particular by the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team. The RSE
team are a part of Imperial ICT combining specialist knowledge in software
engineering with extensive experience in research. The team works with academic
groups on a wide range of projects whilst also organising community events and
training (such as this course) for the benefit of the research community. You
can find out more at the RSE team website (http://bit.ly/2SFropB) and the
Imperial RSE Community website (http://bit.ly/2Hynf0q). You can also consult the
expertise of the RSE team at the weekly RCS clinic (http://bit.ly/2SENqbU).

You may also be interested in attending another course developed by the RSE team
titled \textbf{``Essential Software Engineering for Researchers''} bookable via the Graduate School (http://bit.ly/2SHIwuI).
