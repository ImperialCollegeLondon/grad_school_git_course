This course was developed by the Research Computing Service (RCS) of Imperial
College, in particular by the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team. The RSE
team are a part of Imperial ICT combining specialist knowledge in software
engineering with extensive experience in research. The team works with academic
groups on a wide range of projects whilst also organising community events and
training (such as this) for the benefit of the research community. You can find
